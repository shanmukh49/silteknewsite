         may suggest industrial oriented mini projects so that students can find application of their 
         
         theoretical concepts in industries. The aim of Industrial oriented mini projects is that students 
         
         could know the applications of their theoretical knowledge in various Industries and to get 
         
         practical knowledge and to get updated or to instill passion to develop different concepts in 
         
         which the industry finds more applications. The lack of imparting hands-on field experience in 
         
         engineering streams creates serious employability problems for the graduates and the industry. 
         
         They don't have any experience &amp; exposure to the Industry world. These needs can be fulfilled 
         
         through Industry Oriented Mini Projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Siltek Software Solutions (I) Pvt. Ltd</span> is specifically working on a planned strategy of 
         
         Industry Oriented Mini Projects for the students. This will help them to have an actual feel of 
         
         the Industry, make them effective engineers and help them in their placements. The students 
         
         will be exposed to industrial environment. Students will understand technical concepts, 
         
         organizational structure, functioning of various departments, realization of products / services, 
         
         corporate etiquettes, and organizational practices.</span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
