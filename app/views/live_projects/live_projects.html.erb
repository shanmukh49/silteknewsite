         that involves students in investigations of real time problems and risks while
         developing the projects. Projects that make for stronger classroom learning
         opportunities can vary widely in subject matter and scope, and can be delivered
         at a wide range of class levels. Projects serve specific, significant
         educational goals; they are not diversions or add-on to the “real” curriculum.</span></p>
