         confidence to work independently and get them more practical experience.
         Through project work, a student will definitely groom into the kind of
         specialists who are much sought after in industry. Academic projects should be
         considered as an important role on the job training before doing real time JOB
         in an MNC. This starts from choosing an innovative project topic up to the
         delivery of project. MNCâ€™s consider academic projects as an opportunity for the
         students to learn the technology thoroughly and also various aspects related to
         software development. That is why they give more importance to academic
         projects in an interview before offering the job. So a good technology combined
         with quality will be the right choice for the students.&nbsp;</span></p>
