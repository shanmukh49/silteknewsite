However, not everyone gets to start the career on a promising note. Most students suffer from a mix of under-skilled and under-exposed. Under-skilled refers to the situation where the student does not have the right skills that industry is looking for. These skills could be a mix of behavioral, communication, cognitive or technical in nature. Under-exposed refers to the situation where student has the requisite skill-set but is not able to connect to the right organization that needs candidates with that skill-set.</span><br></p><p style=" text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">So it is a necessity that the students are made aware of the existing benchmarks so that they equip themselves with the right industry-relevant knowledge that would get them their dream jobs.
