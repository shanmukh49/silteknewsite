        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">In
        short using PHP MySQL we can create dynamic websites. In today's fast growing
        internet environment, web applications are used by many corporate companies and
        enterprise level companies. To create a Web Application we use Server Side
        Scripting Language and Database to store the information. Web applications are Portable,
        Cost Effective, Scalable, Available from any system and enable storing the
        information on server.</span></p>
        
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">We
        can use server side scripting languages like PHP, JSP, ASP and CFM etc to
        create web applications. Out of these PHP is used by more than 50% of the websites
        for creating dynamic applications. We use PHP because its Open Source, Easy to
        learn, Easy to implement and platform independent. Many companies like <b><span style=" font-size: 13px;">Google, Yahoo!,
        Facebook, Digg, Oracle, Wikimedia, Intel, Ebay</span></b> are using PHP MySQL
        Applications. In fact many popular Open Source Software like Drupal, <span style=" font-size: 13px;">Joomla</span>, Wordpress, Moodle and
        OsCommerce are developed using PHP MySQL.</span></p>

        you want to start you career as a Professional PHP Web Developer? Creating web
        applications is not like designing as website, there will be a huge difference
        in web design and web development. In design you have to provide a visual look
        and feel. But developing PHP Application is about writing logic to suit client
        requirements and project specifications. PHP MySQL can only be learnt by
        writing programs, reading other's programs and learning new php stuff
        regularly. So we give the highest priority on practical’s to make you able to
