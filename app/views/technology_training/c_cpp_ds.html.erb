Siltek is ready with those modern bells to enhance your programming skills.</span><br style=""><br style=""><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">This training course on C programming provides a comprehensive introduction to the ANSI C language, emphasizing portability and structured design. The course explains various data types, operators, and the use of control &amp; conditional statements, functions, arrays, aggregate structures, unions, and pointers early on so the students can practice extensively in the hands on labs. The course also includes coverage of portability tips drawn from experienced programmers working in production environments. Comprehensive hands on exercises are integrated throughout to reinforce learning and develop real competency.</span><br style=""><br style=""><span style=" font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The C++ programming hands-on course provides a solid introduction to object-oriented programming concepts, the C++ language, the C++ run-time and development environments and the Standard Template Library (STL). You will learn basic and advanced C++ syntax, constructs, and conventions, become familiar with the API documentation, understand C++â€™s implementation of the OO paradigm, and apply your newly acquired knowledge by writing a number of programs. After completing this course, you should have the ability to read, understand, and analyze most C++ code, and you should have the skills necessary to begin developing C++ programs.<br></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
