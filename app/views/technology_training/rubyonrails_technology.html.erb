        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Ruby on Rails is a rich web application framework
        that creating sophisticated, full featured web applications. With the
        intuitive, straightforward nature of Ruby and the development platform provided
        by Rails, thatâ€™s why Google has recently accepted projects of the</span> <strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Ruby
        on Rails Development Company India</span></strong> <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">in Summer of Code 2013 and Rails
        has been granted five slots that will create boom in Ruby on Rails technology
        in India.</span></p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Ruby is an expressive language deploy by a
        reputed community. It has Frameworks like Rails allow us to put together
        applications quickly and with much less extraneous programs than other
        languages often impose. It will build maintainable applications while still
        shipping code rapidly and balance the boon of bringing in a gem to help ship a
        feature today versus the maintenance cost it may cause later. It can adapt
        patterns from other languages.</span></p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here are some reasons to choose Ruby on Rails for
        your web application.</span></p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Development Speed:</span></strong> <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Ruby on Rails
        allows features to be developed quickly by freeing programmers from repetitive
        coding. Ruby on Rails emphasizes convention over configuration and adopts agile
        development principles. This allows us to go from concept to estimating to
        actual development in a short space of time. This has significant benefits for
        larger projects that can be broken down into smaller parts as well as
        entrepreneurs developing new products and web based ventures.</span></p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Flexibility:</span></strong> <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Ruby on Rails
        offers the ability to easily modify a web application in response to customers
        needs. This allows modifications to be made and new features added to create
        increased functionality in response to changing business needs.</span></p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Reduced Development Cost:</span></strong> <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">In
        addition to the flexibility and development speed, Ruby on Rails is an open
        source technology. By using a freely available platform, it is possible to
        reduce costs without sacrificing performance, speed or security. Developing
        with Ruby on Rails means development cost may be significantly lower than if
        the same project was written in heavier, less flexible, proprietary software
        (non-open-source technologies), like Java or .Net.</span></p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Future Demand:</span></strong> <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">It should come as
        no surprise why entrepreneurs and businesses have chosen Ruby on Rails to
        create their web application.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here are some well known web services that are
